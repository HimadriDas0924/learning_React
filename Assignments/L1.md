1. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

   - CDN(content delivery network)
   - is a distributed network of servers located across different geographical locations.
   - primary purpose: is to deliver content quickly and efficiently.
   - bcz: deliver from nearest server.
   - since multiple server present, so in case of downtime of one, delivers from other.
   - load balancing: distribute traffic among multiple server, so no overload on single server.

2. Why is React known as React?

   - When the underlying data in a React application changes, the framework efficiently updates and re-renders the user interface to reflect those changes.

   - Instead of manually updating the DOM (Document Object Model) when data changes, developers declare how the UI should look based on the current state. React then "reacts" to state changes by automatically updating the DOM to match the new desired UI.

   - React encourages building UIs as a collection of reusable components. These components "react" to changes in their props or state, re-rendering as needed.

   - React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. It "reacts" to changes by first updating this virtual representation and then efficiently applying only the necessary changes to the actual DOM.

3. What is crossorigin in script tag?

   - used when loading scripts from a CDN or different domains (or origins).
   - It helps manage CORS for scripts.
   - It also allows us to get more detailed ERROR information for scripts from other origins.
     - i.e if not used && some error occur in those scripts, it won't give a detailed error.

4. What is diference between React and ReactDOM ?

   - React:

     - core functionality for building user interfaces.
     - defines how to create and manage components.
     - implements the virtual DOM.
     - can be used for web, mobile(react native), other platforms.

   - ReactDOM:
     - rendering react components to web.
     - offer utilities for interacting with actual DOM.
     - designed for web browser.
     - acts as a bridge between react core concepts and web browser.

5. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

   - Size: Development is larger, production is minified and smaller.
   - Performance: Production is optimized for speed, development is slower.
   - Debugging: Development includes warnings and debugging info, production doesn't.
   - Readability: Development is readable, production is minified.
   - Use case: Development for local testing, production for live sites.
   - Error info: Development gives detailed errors, production provides minimal info.
   - Extra checks: Development includes additional checks (e.g., prop-types), production removes these.

   - **NOTE:** In essence, use development for building/testing and production for deploying to users.

6. What is async and defer? - see my Youtube video ;)
